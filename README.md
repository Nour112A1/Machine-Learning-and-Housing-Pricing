A Jupyter Notebook on Machine Learning and House Pricing - A Regression Problem


The purpose of this essay is to analyse a housing dataset using advanced machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information from the AMES Assessorâ€™s Office used in computing assessed values
for individual residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa, USA from 2006 to 2010. During the essay, different regression techniques are applied to 2930 observations with 82 variables, to determine the performances of each techniques and present how powerful machine learning can be in the field of predictive analysis of house pricings.

We used different algorithms namely: Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayesian, k-Nearest Neighbours and Ordinary Least Squares. It was found that RandomForest outperformed all other algorithms,followed by Ordinary Least Square, then k-Nearest Neighbours and finally Gaussian Naive Bayesian.

We also found out that five variables accounted to 90% of the housing prices.
